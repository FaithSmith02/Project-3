Faith Smith's 3rd Project
Hi, My name is Faith Smith and this site is the 3rd project for a class I took called IML 300: Reading and Writing the Web. Over the time of the course, I began to think about what it means to simply create. I thought about what kind of artwork I would create without the boundaries imposed on me by assignments or simply society. In thinking about simply creation, I thought about what I could do to cultivate a space like that. This is where Art of Color comes to play. I wanted to take the time to create a space that would allow artists to showcase anything they wanted, especially younger artists of color. Iâ€™ve also always been fascinated by colorful and playful styles, and as this project continues to grow so will the ways that I integrate color into the interface.
