        <p class="ltext"> In 2018 The Clara Barton School/P.S. 50 was phased out and divided into two schools. The Fairmont Neighborhood School and The Samara Bi-lingual Schools (Fairmont/Samara Community Schools) The schools were re-designed to share the same building. Many schools in the South Bronx were re-designed this way and it is believed that it was because the south Bronx is known to be one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City. Schools that share the same building are usually supported by a non-profit organizations like Children’s Aid which was formally known as the Children’s Aid Society. </p>
        <p class = "ltext">Children’s Aid provides many afterschool programs within these shared schools. Many of the children who attend both the schools and the afterschool programs are undocumented, and they are attending alongside second and third generation children who have attended the same school as their grandparents. The various ethnic groups consist of Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, African Americans, Jamaicans, West Indians and Africans. These are all children of color who are enrolled in these schools, and some are second language learners. </p>
        <p class = "ltext">The Afterschool program Children’s Aid provides give the children exposure to many different cultures and activities such as archery, cooking, podcasting, STEAM building, sports and the arts including photography.</p>
