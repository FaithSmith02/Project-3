            Over the time of a course I took during my spring semester of college in 2022, I began to think about what it means to simply create. I thought about what kind of artwork I would create without the boundaries imposed on me by assignments or simply society. In thinking about simply creation, I thought about what I could do to cultivate a space like that. This is where Art of Color comes to play. I wanted to take the time to create a space that would allow artists to showcase anything they wanted, especially younger artists of color. I’ve also always been fascinated by colorful and playful styles, and as this project continues to grow so will the ways that I integrate color into the interface. If you would like to showcase your art here, please head over to the <a class="submissions" href="submissions.html">submissions page</a>.</p>
